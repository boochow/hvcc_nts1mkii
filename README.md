# hvcc External Generator for NTS-1 mkII

This project is an external generator for [hvcc](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc). It generates code and other necessary files for the KORG [logue SDK for NTS-1 mkII](https://github.com/korginc/logue-sdk/tree/main/platform/nts-1_mkii) from a Pure Data patch. A patch can be converted to an oscillator unit, a modulation effect unit, a delay effect unit, or a reverb effect unit.

## Installation

Clone this repository. In addition, ensure that both hvcc and the logue SDK are installed. You also need GCC/G++ for your development environment to estimate the required heap memory size; see the Appendix for details.

## Usage

1. Add the `hvcc_nts1mkii` directory to your `PYTHONPATH` by running:

   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path-to-hvcc_nts1mkii
   ```

1. To convert your patch, decide the type of unit and run:

   ```bash
   hvcc YOUR_PUREDATA_PATCH.pd -G nts1mkii_{type} -n PATCH_NAME -o DESTINATION_DIR
   ```

   where `{type}` is one of `osc`, `modfx`, `delfx`, or`revfx`. 

   Check the directory `DESTINATION_DIR`; it should contain four directories named `c`, `hv`, `ir`, and `logue_unit`.

1. Move the directory named `logue_unit` under the logue SDK platform directory `logue-sdk/platform/nts-1_mkii`.

1. In the `logue_unit` directory, run:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

   Alternatively, you can specify your platform directory path via a compile-time option:

   ```bash
   make PLATFORMDIR="~/logue-sdk/platform/nutekt-digital" install
   ```

## Examples

A separate repository containing sample patches for this project is available at:

[https://github.com/boochow/nts1mkii_hvcc_examples](https://github.com/boochow/nts1mkii_hvcc_examples)

All examples for [logue SDK v1](https://github.com/boochow/loguesdk_hvcc_examples) are also compatible with this project.

## Receiving Parameters in Your Pure Data Patch

### OSC Unit

#### Knobs

- The `[r shape @hv_param]` object receives the knob A value as an integer (0 to 1023). Alternatively, `[r shape_f @hv_param]` receives a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0.
- The `[r alt @hv_param]` object receives the knob B value as an integer (0 to 1023). Alternatively, `[r alt_f @hv_param]` receives a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0.

#### Pitch and LFO

- The `[r pitch @hv_param]` object receives the oscillator pitch frequency in Hz. Alternatively, `[r pitch_note @hv_param]` receives the oscillator pitch as a floating-point note number.
- The `[r slfo @hv_param]` object receives the shape LFO value, which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. Remember that the shape LFO is a control value, not a signal value.

#### Note Events

- The `[r noteon_trig @hv_param]` object receives a `bang` when a MIDI Note On event occurs.
- The `[r noteoff_trig @hv_param]` object receives a `bang` when a MIDI Note Off event occurs.

### ModFx / DelFx / RevFx Unit

#### Knobs

- The `[r time @hv_param]` object receives the knob A value as an integer (0 to 1023). Alternatively, `[r time_f @hv_param]` receives a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0.
- The `[r depth @hv_param]` object receives the knob B value as an integer (0 to 1023). Alternatively, `[r depth_f @hv_param]` receives a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0.

- With DelFX and RevFX units, the `[r mix @hv_param]` object receives the mix knob (DELAY or REVERB button + knob B) value as an integer (-1000 to 1000). Alternatively, `[r mix_f @hv_param]` receives a floating-point value between -1.0 and 1.0. Logue SDK assumes that -1000 and -1.0 represent 100% dry sound, zero represents 50% dry/50% wet sound, 1000 and 1.0 represent 100% wet sound.

### Parameters (available for all types of units)

Any `[r]` object whose variable name does not match those described above but includes the `@hv_param` parameter is recognized as a parameter. Up to eight  parameters can be used for oscillator units and modFx units, seven for delFx and revFx units.

#### Specifying Parameter Slot Number

Optionally, you can specify the parameter slot by adding a prefix `_N_` (where N is a number from 1 to 8) to the variable name. The remainder of the name is used as the variable name on the synthesizerâ€™s display. For example, the variable name `_3_ratio` assigns the parameter "ratio" to slot 3.

#### Receiving Floating-Point Values

By default, all variables receive raw integer values from the logue SDK API. You can specify a minimum value, a maximum value, and a default value like this:
`[r varname @hv_param 1 5 3]`

When the minimum, maximum, and default values are omitted, they are assumed to be `[0 1 0]`. The default value must be specified when the minimum and the maximum values are specified. 

A variable with the postfix `_f` receives a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0 (mapped from integer values between 0 and 1023). You can optionally specify the minimum, maximum, and default values using the syntax:

```
[r varname @hv_param min max default]
```

#### Parameter Type

`mix` and `mix_f` are always considered as a `k_unit_param_type_drywet` type parameter. All other parameters are defined as floating-point type or integer type according to whether their name ends with `_f` or not.

## Restrictions

### DAC and ADC

The logue SDK oscillator units support only a 48,000 Hz sampling rate. The number of channels of `[dac~]` object must be 1 for oscillator units, 2 for other type of units. The number of channels of `[adc~]` must be 2 for all types of units.

### Memory Footprint

A unit must fit within the [Max RAM load size](https://github.com/korginc/logue-sdk/blob/main/platform/nts-1_mkii/README.md#supported-modules). While no error will occur in the build process when the binary file might exceed this limit, a warning message below will appear after build process:

``` Memory footprint: 29796 bytes
 Memory footprint: 29796 bytes
 WARNING: Memory footprint exceeds 24576
```

### `msg_toString()` does not work

To reduce the memory footprint, `hv_snprintf()` is replaced by an empty function. The `msg_toString()` function does not work because it requires `hv_snprintf()`.

### Size of the Heap Memory

Due to ensure that your unit will fit within the memory space limitation, you must specify the heap size of your unit before the build process. The heap size can be set as a compiler flag:

```makefile
-DUNIT_HEAP_SIZE=3072
```

The heap size estimation process is integrated into `config.mk`, or you can manually specify the size like this:

```bash
make HEAP_SIZE=4096
```

For automatic estimation, this external generator creates `testmem.c` and `Makefile.testmem`. When GCC and G++ are available, `testmem.c` is built and executed from `config.mk`, and the estimated heap size is saved in `logue_heap_size.mk`.

You can check the `malloc()` calls and the total requested memory for generating the first 960,000 samples by running:

```bash
make -f Makefile.testmem
./testmem
```

If GCC and G++ are not available in your development environment, the default heap size (3072 bytes) is used. (Note: In the Docker image version of the logue SDK build environment, GCC/G++ are not provided, so the default heap size is always used.)

### Size of the SDRAM allocation

The source code generated by this external generator allocates memory blocks which size are larger than 256 bytes in the SDRAM area. This feature is enabled for the modfx, delfx, and revfx units to store large data such as a delay line. 

Since logue SDK requires units to allocate SDRAM blocks in their initialization process, you must specify the total SDRAM size of your unit before the build process. The size for your unit is estimated within the same process as heap memory size estimation, so usually you do not need to estimate it by yourself. 

### Math Functions Approximation

Some math functions have been replaced with logue SDK functions that provide approximate values. If you get inaccurate results, comment out the following line in `config.mk`:

```makefile
UDEFS += -DLOGUE_FAST_MATH
```

to disable the fast math approximation. Note that disabling this may result in a larger binary size.

### Internal Sampling Rate

To reduce processing load, an oscillator unit generated by this generator can calculate only half of the requested sample frames and interpolates them to generate the other half. This results in the sound lacking harmonics above 12 KHz, and many artifacts may appear in higher notes if no band-limiting technique is used. You can edit the `config.mk` file and enable the commented line:

```makefile
UDEFS += -DRENDER_HALF
```

to have this feature enabled.

### Filling a Table with White Noise

Any table whose name ends with `_r` that is exposed using the `@hv_table` notation is always filled with white noise using the logue SDK function `osc_white()`. This feature can be used to replace the `[noise~]` object with the much lighter `[tabread~]` object.

However, note that:

1. Filling the buffer with `osc_white()` requires significant processing time, so keep the table size as small as possible (typically 64 samples).
2. To generate white noise, you also need a `[phasor~ freq]`, `[*~ tablesize]`, and `[tabread~]` object. The value of `freq` should be `48000 / tablesize`.
